# SmallTube: Limit recommendations on the YouTube home page based on your intention.

SmallTube is a Chrome extension that encourages more intentional YouTube browsing. Upon reaching the YouTube home page, the extension:
- hides the current videos
- asks how many recommendations you want to see
- will not show any more until the timer you specified expires.

## Installation

This extension is not yet submitted to the Chrome Extension store, so there is a different process for installation.

1. Navigate to the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/markromanmiller/smalltube/releases) for the
extension.
2. Select the most recent release, and download the source code ZIP file.
3. Save the ZIP file to some location on your computer, and unzip the archive. Be sure to remember the location to which you unzipped the file.
4. Open your Google Chrome browser (or other Chromium-based browser, such as Microsoft Edge or Brave).
5. On the extensions page (chrome://extensions), look to the top right and enable "Developer Mode". This should make a few buttons appear.
6. Press the button labeled "Load Unpacked"
7. Select the directory in which you unzipped the file from step 3.
